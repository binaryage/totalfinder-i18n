## Do you want to translate TotalFinder into your language?

You can tweak resource files and add your preferred language.

You should push your changes back to GitHub and I will then incorporate your work into [next TotalFinder release](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/beta-changes).

## Where to start?

1. Read something about git version control system. Here is [the best place to start](http://git-scm.com).
2. Get familiar with GitHub. They have also [nice docs](http://help.github.com).
3. Create GitHub user and don't forget to [setup your local git](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git) so your commits are linked to your GitHub account.
4. See how others are working on [TotalFinder localization](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/network).

## Questions?

### What encoding should I use for my files?
> Please always use UTF-8. Other encodings will probably fail to load or you will see wrong characters. Run `rake validate` task to check your files.
